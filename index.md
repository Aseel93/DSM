# Summery 
Design Structure Matrices (DSMs) are square matrices that display relationships between components of a system in a compact, visual, and analytically advantageous format. These matrices are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and electronics industries for the purpose of improving system design and product architecture. The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning to develop a program that generates DSMs based on preferences provided by the user, like number of system components, system complexity, etc. Having access to substantial amounts of DSMs with varying complexities can be helpful to researchers as it can save time and resources by eliminating the need to scrape information from websites or repositories.

# Data
To achieve the goals of this research project and develop the DSM generator, a significant amount of data will be needed for the purpose of training an algorithm. The dataset includes more than 2000 DSMs extracted from a repository published by Oregon State [Source](http://ftest.mime.oregonstate.edu/repo/browse/). However, the DSMs downloaded from the online repository are unlabeled and do not show an indication for their complexity. While there are many studies that investigate measures of complexity, very few define complexity for directed graphs. One such study proposes a polynomial-based approach to measuring complexity of directed graphs [Paper Link] (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223745)

_Smoller is correlated to cuter_ [4]

# Takeaways
__A final section summarizes big takeaways in a concise format__
- Puppies are cute
- Smoler = cuter
- Future work should investigate how smol is too smol
