DSM is a powerful methodology which can be used to optimize a system or process based on dependencies among each component and provides a simple and concise way to represent complex systems.

The goal of our project is to develop Design Structure Matrices (DSMs) generator in order to allow users to modify the output by specifying the number of components that they would like in the DSM and choosing the complexity level that related to their system.
